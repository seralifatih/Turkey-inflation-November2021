# Calculating Inflation Rate in Turkey with Official Data - November 2021


In this project, I calculated the November 2021 Inflation rate in Turkey based on the official. The inspiration for this project came from an EkşiSözlük [entry](https://eksisozluk.com/tuike-gore-enflasyonun-31-31-olmasi--7101397) questioning the accuracy of the official calculation. 


## Data source

The data is directly taken from the website of Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). [Link](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Consumer-Price-Index-November-2021-37389&dil=2) to the data. 
## Future of the project
I don't consider this project to be finished at the moment. I'm planning to calculate monthly changes and add plots for easy reference.
