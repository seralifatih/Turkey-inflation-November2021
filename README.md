# Calculating Inflation Rate in Turkey with Official Data 


In this project, I created some tools that can calculate inflation rate in Turkey between two different dates. It is also possible to create a line plot to demonstrate the monthly inflation changes. The inspiration for this project came from an EkşiSözlük [entry](https://eksisozluk.com/tuike-gore-enflasyonun-31-31-olmasi--7101397) questioning the accuracy of the official calculation. 


## Data source

The data is directly taken from the website of Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). [Link](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Tuketici-Fiyat-Endeksi-Aralik-2021-45789) to the data. As of 6 January 2022, the latest data is available for December 2021. If you use this tool at a later date, make sure to download the Excel file from TUIK's website.
## Future of the project
This project has been improved from it's first commit but there are still many areas open for improvement.
